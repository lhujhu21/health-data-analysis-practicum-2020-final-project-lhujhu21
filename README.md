##### Comments from Dr. Taub (4/6/2020): 

* Nice start, Lucy!
* It looks like this data set will require some processing/wrangling. You need to skip a couple of lines when you are reading it in, but then only select certain columns, and it is not clear to me in looking at the csv file exactly what questions and responses are being recorded. Also, some states seem to have more than one measurement (i.e., some have measurements for specific counties) so that will also need to be dealt with.
* Maybe you have already done this, but if you click on the "2018 Dashboard" link on the website you gave, it helped me understand what is in the csv file. Apparently, they need more than one dose of the vaccine. Perhaps you want to just use the rates of people who are "up to date" on the vaccine? (Starts in column HJ if you open the csv file in Excel.) I'm happy to explain more what I mean by this in office hours or over email.
* I understand that you might want to include additional variables, but given that the data set itself is a little complicated to begin with, perhaps you can just start with looking at the relationship between vaccine rates and poverty, since those variables are both contained here?
* I think this question is really interesting and it looks like a cool data set!
